# Goal
Create an implementation of python like lists in c :
1. Be able to change the size of the list without restrictions (other than the heap size)
2. Be able to insert elements at arbitrary indexes in the list (all elements will still be the same type)
3. Add support for multidimensional lists
4. Mix types inside the same list (optional)

# How

I will try multiple implementations.

## Linked list

First an implementation using a simple linked list.
